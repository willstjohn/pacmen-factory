# PacMen Exercise

## Description
In this project, the user is greeted with a blank page and two buttons: Add Pac Man and Start Game.
The user can add as many Pac Men as they wish and when they hit Start Game they begin to bounce around the page,
reflecting off the edges of the window, irrespective of window size.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine and unzip the folder.
2. Open a new window in your browser and drag the `index.html` file onto it.
3. Press the Add Pac Man button to add as many Pac Men as you'd like.
4. Press Start Game to watch the Pac Men bounce around.

## Roadmap
In the future, I would like to make the Pac Men turn around when they hit a wall as well as gobble while they move.
